      <h2>Why Cats are the Best!</h2>
      <h3>Cats are the best types of pets for many reasons. Cats just like to lay around the house all day! That might
        not sound exciting to a few people, but would you rather have a cat that likes to take naps and cuddle with you,
        or a dog who runs around and breaks everything? Which leads to the next point, cats keep themselves clean. As
        long as their litter box is emptied regularly, and they have food, you aren't going to find a puddle of pee on
        the ground, and you don't have to endure the glaring eyes of all the neighbors while your dog poops on your
        grass.
      </h3>
      <h3>Cats are better than dogs. I would rather have peace and quiet with a floof who sits next to me and loves to
        be pet, rather that a dog who is always trying to jump onto my lap and play fetch in the house. Cats are Cool.
